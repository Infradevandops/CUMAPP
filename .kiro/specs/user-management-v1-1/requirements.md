# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for SMSPROJ v1.1, which focuses on implementing comprehensive user management, persistent conversation storage, enhanced chat interface, phone number purchasing workflow, and advanced verification management. These features will transform the platform from a demo-ready application into a production-ready multi-user communication platform with proper authentication, data persistence, and user-specific functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Management System

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to create an account and securely log in, so that I can access my personal conversations, phone numbers, and verification history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL provide a form to create an account with email, username, password, and optional full name
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration information THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with hashed password and send a verification email
3. WHEN a user attempts to log in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and provide a JWT token for session management
4. WHEN a user provides invalid login credentials THEN the system SHALL reject the login attempt and display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN an authenticated user accesses protected endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token and allow access to user-specific resources
6. WHEN a user's JWT token expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication before accessing protected resources
7. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the current session and redirect to the login page

### Requirement 2: Persistent Conversation Storage

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want my conversations and messages to be permanently stored, so that I can access my message history across sessions and devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends or receives a message THEN the system SHALL store the message in the database with proper user association
2. WHEN a user creates a new conversation THEN the system SHALL persist the conversation details and participant information
3. WHEN a user accesses their conversation list THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display all conversations associated with their account
4. WHEN a user opens a specific conversation THEN the system SHALL load and display the complete message history for that conversation
5. WHEN a user searches for messages THEN the system SHALL query the database and return matching results from their accessible conversations
6. WHEN the system restarts THEN all conversation data SHALL remain intact and accessible to users
7. WHEN a user deletes a conversation THEN the system SHALL mark it as archived while preserving the data for potential recovery

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Chat Interface

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want an improved chat interface with better user experience features, so that I can communicate more effectively and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the chat interface THEN the system SHALL display a modern, responsive design with conversation list and message area
2. WHEN a user selects a conversation THEN the system SHALL load and display the conversation with proper message threading and timestamps
3. WHEN a user types a message THEN the system SHALL show typing indicators to other participants in real-time
4. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and delivery confirmation
5. WHEN a user receives a new message THEN the system SHALL display desktop notifications (if permitted) and update the conversation list
6. WHEN a user scrolls up in a conversation THEN the system SHALL load older messages with infinite scroll functionality
7. WHEN a user mentions another user THEN the system SHALL provide autocomplete suggestions and highlight mentions
8. WHEN a user attaches a file THEN the system SHALL support basic file sharing with size and type restrictions

### Requirement 4: Phone Number Purchasing Workflow

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to purchase and manage dedicated phone numbers, so that I can have consistent sender identities for my SMS communications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the phone number marketplace THEN the system SHALL display available numbers by country with pricing information
2. WHEN a user selects a phone number to purchase THEN the system SHALL show detailed information including monthly cost and capabilities
3. WHEN a user confirms a phone number purchase THEN the system SHALL process the transaction and associate the number with their account
4. WHEN a user views their owned numbers THEN the system SHALL display all purchased numbers with usage statistics and renewal dates
5. WHEN a user's phone number subscription expires THEN the system SHALL send renewal notifications and handle automatic renewals if configured
6. WHEN a user cancels a phone number subscription THEN the system SHALL process the cancellation and update the number status
7. WHEN a user sends SMS from an owned number THEN the system SHALL use that number as the sender identity
8. WHEN a user receives SMS on an owned number THEN the system SHALL route the message to their conversation interface

### Requirement 5: Advanced Verification Management

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want comprehensive management of my verification requests, so that I can track, organize, and efficiently handle multiple verification processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a verification request THEN the system SHALL store the request details and associate it with their account
2. WHEN a user views their verification history THEN the system SHALL display all past and current verification requests with status and details
3. WHEN a verification request receives SMS codes THEN the system SHALL automatically extract and display the codes to the user
4. WHEN a user searches their verification history THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by service, date range, and status
5. WHEN a verification request expires THEN the system SHALL update the status and notify the user of expiration
6. WHEN a user cancels a verification request THEN the system SHALL process the cancellation and update the request status
7. WHEN a user exports verification data THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable reports in common formats (CSV, JSON)
8. WHEN a verification request completes successfully THEN the system SHALL mark it as completed and store the final verification code

### Requirement 6: User Dashboard and Profile Management

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want a personalized dashboard and profile management, so that I can monitor my usage, manage my account settings, and track my subscription status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display usage statistics, recent activity, and account status
2. WHEN a user views their profile THEN the system SHALL show account information with options to edit personal details
3. WHEN a user updates their profile information THEN the system SHALL validate and save the changes with appropriate confirmation
4. WHEN a user changes their password THEN the system SHALL require current password verification and enforce password strength requirements
5. WHEN a user views their usage statistics THEN the system SHALL display SMS count, verification requests, and subscription limits
6. WHEN a user approaches their usage limits THEN the system SHALL display warnings and upgrade options
7. WHEN a user manages API keys THEN the system SHALL allow generation, rotation, and revocation of API access tokens
8. WHEN a user configures notification preferences THEN the system SHALL respect their choices for email and in-app notifications

### Requirement 7: API Authentication and Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a developer using the platform API, I want secure authentication and fair usage policies, so that I can integrate the platform into my applications while ensuring system stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer makes an API request THEN the system SHALL require valid authentication via JWT token or API key
2. WHEN an API request exceeds rate limits THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and retry-after headers
3. WHEN an API key is compromised THEN the system SHALL allow immediate revocation and replacement
