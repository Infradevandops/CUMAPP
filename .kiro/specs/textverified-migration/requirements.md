# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing FastAPI SMS verification application into a comprehensive communication platform by integrating both Twilio and TextVerified APIs. The enhanced application will provide:

**Core Capabilities:**
1. **Service Verification**: Use TextVerified to help users verify accounts on third-party services (WhatsApp, Google, etc.)
2. **Direct Communication**: Use Twilio for sending/receiving SMS and making/receiving voice calls to/from real phone numbers
3. **Number Provisioning**: Provide users with dedicated phone numbers for long-term use (1+ months) or short-term verification
4. **International Support**: Handle international SMS and voice communication with smart routing
5. **Voice Features**: Full voice calling capabilities including call recording, forwarding, and conference calls
6. **Subscription Management**: Support both purchase and subscription models for number access
7. **Conversational Interface**: Enable two-way SMS communication with Groq AI model integration for fast response suggestions

The platform will serve as a bridge between users needing verification services and those requiring dedicated communication numbers, with flexible pricing models for different use cases.
