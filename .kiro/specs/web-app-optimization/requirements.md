# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for completing the web application optimization project based on the existing Web-App-Improve tasks. The project focuses on finishing the React migration, eliminating duplicate files/folders, fixing deployment errors, and implementing the remaining performance optimizations and user experience enhancements.
