## 🚨 Critical Production Issues to Address

Based on code review findings:

### 🔴 **High Priority**
1. **XSS Vulnerabilities**: Implement input sanitization in frontend JS
2. **CSRF Protection**: Add CSRF tokens to all state-changing operations
3. **Code Injection**: Sanitize all dynamic HTML generation
4. **Missing Authorization**: Add auth checks to sensitive endpoints

### 🟡 **Medium Priority**
