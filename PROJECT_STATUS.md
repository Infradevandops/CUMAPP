3. **No user authentication** (planned for Phase 2)
4. **Limited rate limiting** (basic implementation in Nginx)

### **Production Considerations**
1. **SSL certificates** needed for HTTPS
2. **Environment-specific configurations** for different deployments
3. **Monitoring and alerting** setup required
4. **Backup and disaster recovery** procedures needed
