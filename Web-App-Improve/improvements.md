# Web Application Improvements Roadmap

This document outlines suggested improvements for modernizing and maturing the web application, categorized for clarity and tracking.

## 1. General Web App Improvements

*   [ ] **Frontend Framework Adoption:**
    *   **Description:** Integrate a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) to enhance interactivity, enable component-based development, and improve state management. This will facilitate a more dynamic and responsive user interface.
    *   **Rationale:** Moves away from traditional server-side rendering for interactive elements, leading to a smoother user experience and more maintainable frontend code.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [x] Research and select a suitable frontend framework.
        *   [x] Set up a new frontend project within the existing structure or as a separate module.
        *   [x] Migrate a simple component (e.g., a button or a small form) to the new framework.
        *   [x] Establish a clear component architecture and development workflow.

*   [ ] **Responsive Design:**
    *   **Description:** Implement a fully responsive layout across all pages to ensure optimal viewing and interaction on diverse devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    *   **Rationale:** Essential for reaching a wider audience and providing a consistent user experience regardless of device.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [x] Conduct an audit of existing pages for responsiveness issues. (Note: base_layout.html was empty, further investigation needed for actual base layout file.)
        *   [ ] Integrate a responsive CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap) or refine existing media queries.
        *   [ ] Test responsiveness across various screen sizes and orientations.

*   [ ] **Accessibility (A11y):**
    *   **Description:** Enhance accessibility by adhering to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), including semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and sufficient color contrast.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures the application is usable by individuals with disabilities, broadening the user base and complying with best practices.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [ ] Perform an accessibility audit using tools like Lighthouse or Axe.
        *   [ ] Update HTML structures to use semantic tags.
        *   [ ] Add appropriate ARIA roles and attributes.
        *   [ ] Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable.
        *   [ ] Verify color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards.

*   [ ] **Performance Optimization:**

    *   **Rationale:** Faster applications lead to better user satisfaction, higher engagement, and improved SEO.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [ ] **Asset Minification & Bundling:** Automate minification of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and bundle them to reduce HTTP requests.
        *   [ ] **Image Optimization:** Implement lazy loading for images, use modern image formats (e.g., WebP), and responsive image techniques (`srcset`).
        *   [ ] **Code Splitting & Caching:** Optimize asset loading through code splitting (loading only necessary JavaScript for each view) and implement robust caching strategies for static assets and API responses.
        *   [ ] **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG):** Evaluate and implement SSR or SSG for initial page loads where appropriate, especially for content-heavy pages.

*   [ ] **User Experience (UX) Enhancements:**

    *   **Rationale:** Protecting user data and maintaining application integrity is paramount.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [ ] **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to mitigate common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
        *   [ ] **Input Sanitization:** Ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized on the client-side (in addition to existing server-side validation) to prevent injection attacks.
        *   [ ] **Secure Cookies:** Ensure cookies are set with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes.

*   [ ] **Internationalization (i18n) & Localization (l10n):**
    *   **Description:** Implement a robust system for multi-language support and regional content adaptation.
    *   **Rationale:** Expands the application's reach to a global audience.
