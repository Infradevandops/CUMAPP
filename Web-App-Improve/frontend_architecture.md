# Frontend Architecture and Development Workflow (React)

This document outlines the proposed component architecture and development workflow for the new React frontend.

## 1. Component Architecture

We will adopt a component-based architecture, organizing our React application into reusable, modular components.

### 1.1. Component Categorization

Components will be categorized based on their reusability and responsibility:

*   **Atomic Components (Atoms):** Smallest UI elements, such as buttons, inputs, typography, icons. These are purely presentational and have no business logic.
*   **Molecular Components (Molecules):** Groups of atoms bonded together to form a simple, reusable UI component (e.g., a search input with a button, a form field with a label).
*   **Organisms:** Relatively complex UI components composed of molecules and/or atoms, forming distinct sections of an interface (e.g., a header, a sidebar, a product card).
*   **Templates:** Page-level layouts that arrange organisms into a coherent structure, focusing on content structure rather than final content.
*   **Pages:** Specific instances of templates, populating them with real data and handling page-specific logic and routing.

### 1.2. Folder Structure

The `frontend/src` directory will follow a logical, feature-based folder structure:

```
frontend/src/
├── components/         # Reusable UI components (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms)
│   ├── atoms/
│   │   ├── Button.js
│   │   └── Input.js
│   ├── molecules/
│   │   ├── SearchBar.js
│   │   └── FormField.js
│   └── organisms/
│       ├── Header.js
│       └── Sidebar.js
├── pages/              # Page-level components (Templates, Pages)
│   ├── HomePage.js
│   ├── DashboardPage.js
│   └── AuthPage.js
├── services/           # API calls, external integrations
│   ├── authService.js
│   └── dataService.js
├── hooks/              # Custom React Hooks
│   ├── useAuth.js
│   └── useForm.js
├── contexts/           # React Context API for global state
│   ├── AuthContext.js
│   └── ThemeContext.js
├── utils/              # Utility functions (helpers, formatters)
│   ├── helpers.js
│   └── validators.js
├── assets/             # Static assets (images, fonts)
│   ├── images/
│   └── fonts/
├── styles/             # Global styles, theme definitions
│   ├── index.css
│   └── theme.js
├── App.js              # Main application component
├── index.js            # Entry point
└── reportWebVitals.js
```

## 2. Development Workflow

### 2.1. Branching Strategy

We will use a Git Flow-like branching strategy:

*   `main`: Production-ready code.
*   `develop`: Integration branch for new features.
*   `feature/<feature-name>`: Branches for developing new features.
*   `bugfix/<bug-name>`: Branches for fixing bugs.
*   `release/<version>`: Branches for preparing new releases.

### 2.2. Code Review

All code changes will undergo a peer code review process before merging into `develop` or `main`.

### 2.3. Linting and Formatting

We will use ESLint for code linting and Prettier for code formatting to ensure code consistency.

*   **ESLint:** Configured to enforce best practices and identify potential issues.
*   **Prettier:** Configured to automatically format code on save.

### 2.4. Testing

*   **Unit Tests:** Jest and React Testing Library will be used for unit testing individual components and functions.
*   **Integration Tests:** Focus on testing the interaction between multiple components or modules.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Tools like Cypress or Playwright will be used for testing user flows across the entire application.

### 2.5. State Management

For state management, we will primarily use React's built-in `useState` and `useContext` hooks for local and global state respectively. For more complex global state needs, we may consider libraries like Redux Toolkit or Zustand.

### 2.6. API Communication

We will use `fetch` API or a library like Axios for making API requests to the backend. Data fetching will often be managed within custom hooks or dedicated service files.

### 2.7. Build and Deployment

*   The React application will be built into static assets using `npm run build`.
*   These static assets will be served by the Python backend or a dedicated web server (e.g., Nginx).
*   CI/CD pipelines will be set up for automated testing, building, and deployment.
